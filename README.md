# 3_tier_app
## Scope 
This is a simple app that I have developed to create a 3 tiered app across 4 servers. A Load balancer will be the main system which then disperces web requests between 2 Apache Web hosts. These Apache systems then display a website that pulls data from a MariaDB database located on another server
